# PD Buddy Sink

This is the circuit board for the PD Buddy Sink, a device which aims to make
USB Power Delivery accessible to any electronics hobbyist.

The board is designed for 2 oz copper.  It's probably best to use a 1.0 or 0.8
mm thick PCB to make sure it's possible to solder the USB connector's pins.

The PCB is made with [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/), so you'll need that if you
want to make any changes.
