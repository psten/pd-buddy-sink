# PD Buddy Sink

This is the circuit board for the PD Buddy Sink, a device which aims to make
USB Power Delivery accessible to any electronics hobbyist.

The board is designed for 1 oz copper on all layers.  1.6 mm thickness should
be fine.  Just keep in mind that it isn't possible to assemble the board with a
soldering iron anymore!

The PCB is made with [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/), so you'll need that if you
want to make any changes.  Several PCB fabricators accept KiCad PCB files
directly now, but if you intend to order from one that does not, you'll need
KiCad to plot the Gerbers.
